Another year has passed and once again I’ve had the privilege of going through the Web Tools Weekly newsletter archives from the past 12 months to hunt down the front-end tools that readers found to be the most interesting during 2021. So, to kick off 2022, I’ve compiled a list of the 60 most popular tools. I’m sure there are at least one or two listed here that you can start using in your front-end projects today.

Some of these front-end tools are super-practical, while others probably only made this list due to curiosity (which I base on the number of unique clicks). And since many of the tools that make my year-end lists are pretty new, I think this is a good indicator of the kinds of front-end tools that will be popular in the coming year.

## 2. [Tails](https://devdojo.com/tails/app)

According to the State of CSS 2021, Tailwind CSS cpaontinues to grow in popularity. In fact, we now have the first Tailwind-based tool that allows users to create pages with a drag-and-drop interface. This front-end tool is specifically designed for projects using Tailwind CSS, which is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and customizable UI components. With this new tool, developers can now enjoy the benefits of both Tailwind and a drag-and-drop interface, streamlining their workflow and enhancing productivity.

## 3. [Animated Backgrounds](https://animatedbackgrounds.me/)

This tool made the top 60 this year, but may not be the most practical. It's a gallery of animated backgrounds sourced from various CodePen demos, often clicked on out of curiosity.
