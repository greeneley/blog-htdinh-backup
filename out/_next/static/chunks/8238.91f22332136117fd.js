To "tell" GPT-3 what output you want, you have to use what is referred to by the OpenAI team as the few-shot learning technique where you provide just a few examples of what you expect as input. There are other ways to "guide" GPT-3 into being more specific with its output by using fine-tuning.\n\nsummary: GPT-3 is not trainable. To get the output you want, you need to provide a few examples of what you expect as input.\n    ']}],b=function(e){var t=e.set,o=e.toggle,d=e.rows,c=void 0===d?9:d,m=u.useRef(null),b=(0,s.Z)(u.useState(t),2),v=b[0],x=b[1],I=u.useMemo((function(){return w[v].prompt}),[v]),k=u.useMemo((function(){return w[v].completions}),[v]),T=(0,s.Z)(u.useState({status:"idle",value:I,base:I}),2),G=T[0],S=T[1],L=u.useCallback((function(e){S({status:"idle",value:w[e].prompt,base:w[e].prompt})}),[]),j=function(){m&&m.current&&(m.current.scrollTop=m.current.scrollHeight)},P=function(){var e=(0,n.Z)((function(){var e;return(0,r.__generator)(this,(function(t){return S((function(e){return(0,a.Z)((0,i.Z)({},e),{status:"submitting"})})),e=k[Math.floor(Math.random()*k.length)],setTimeout((function(){S((function(t){return(0,a.Z)((0,i.Z)({},t),{status:"idle",value:e})})),j()}),1200),[2]}))}));return function(){return e.apply(this,arguments)}}();return u.useEffect((function(){j()}),[]),(0,h.jsx)(l.a,{css:{marginBottom:"2.25rem"},children:(0,h.jsxs)(l.a.Body,{children:[(0,h.jsx)(f,{"aria-label":"Prompt",label:"Prompt",id:"playground-1",value:G.value,onChange:function(){},readOnly:!0,resize:"none",rows:c,ref:m}),(0,h.jsx)("br",{}),o?(0,h.jsxs)(h.Fragment,{children:[(0,h.jsx)(g.a,{"aria-label":o.text,id:o.id,label:o.text,toggled:v===o.targetSet,onChange:function(e){e.target.checked?(x(o.targetSet),L(o.targetSet)):(x(t),L(t))}}),(0,h.jsx)("br",{})]}):null,(0,h.jsxs)(p.a,{alignItems:"center",justifyContent:"space-between",children:[(0,h.jsx)(y.a,{disabled:"submitting"===G.status,variant:"primary",onClick:function(){return P()},children:"submitting"===G.status?"Computing \ud83e\udd16":"Submit \u2728"}),(0,h.jsx)(y.a,{variant:"secondary",onClick:function(){return S((function(e){return(0,a.Z)((0,i.Z)({},e),{value:e.base})}))},children:"Reset"})]})]})})}}}]);
